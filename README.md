# Ex-4.-Scenario-Based-Report-Development-Utilizing-Diverse-Prompting-Techniques
Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Aim: 
The aim of this experiment is to demonstrate the practical application of prompt engineering and structured development methodologies in the creation of a functional, AI-powered conversational agent. By utilizing diverse prompting techniques, we will systematically collect data, design model prompts, test performance, and generate a comprehensive final report.

## Algorithm: 
The experiment follows a five-phase, iterative algorithm:

Project Scoping and Design: The chatbot's core functionalities, persona, and target audience are defined. This phase uses persona-based and chain-of-thought prompting to simulate a product manager's thought process and systematically outline customer inquiries.

Data Collection and Preparation: A relevant and robust dataset is created for training and fine-tuning the chatbot's language model. This phase employs in-context learning (few-shot) and constraint-based prompting to generate initial training data and then augment it with diverse, real-world examples, including typos and informal language.

Model Development and Prompt Engineering: The primary operational prompt for the large language model (LLM) is designed. This involves crafting a detailed system prompt using instructional prompting and creating a clear few-shot example using few-shot prompting to guide the model's behavior.

Testing and Analysis: The chatbot's performance is evaluated using predefined test cases. This phase leverages structured and analytical prompting to create a rigorous testing framework and systematically identify points of failure and areas for improvement.

Report Generation: The findings and results of the experiment are compiled into a formal engineering report. Outline-based and summary-based prompting are used to create a detailed report structure and draft the abstract.

## Objective

The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. The project will be guided by various AI prompting techniques to manage different phases of development, from initial design to final report creation.

## Prompt:
The experiment is driven by a series of structured prompts, each tailored to a specific phase of the chatbot's development. These prompts are the core of the methodology, replacing traditional manual instructions with a systematic, AI-guided approach. For example, the prompts for Phase 1 are:

Prompt 1 (Persona-based): "Act as a product manager for a new retail chatbot... List three key functionalities..."

Prompt 2 (Chain-of-thought): "Think step-by-step about the most common questions customers ask in a retail environment..."

## Output:

The expected outputs at each phase of the experiment are as follows:

Phase 1: A well-defined chatbot persona and a list of key functionalities with sample conversational flows.

Phase 2: A curated dataset of customer questions and corresponding chatbot responses, including a diverse range of phrasings.

Phase 3: A complete and effective system prompt and a few-shot example to guide the core chatbot logic.

Phase 4: A comprehensive set of test cases and an analysis of chatbot performance, with proposed solutions for observed failures.

Phase 5: A detailed engineering report summarizing the entire experiment, from design to results.

## Result:

The result of this experiment will be a functional, AI-powered chatbot prototype named 'Retail Buddy' that can successfully handle common customer inquiries in a retail environment. The project will also yield a detailed report that outlines the methodology, challenges, and successes encountered during the development process, demonstrating the value of a prompt-driven approach to AI engineering.
